# Pymaceuticals_challenge
Analyzing data to determine which drugs from eight that were choosen would be the best at decreasing tumor volume (mm3) over a period of 45 days in mice that have Small Cell Carcinoma.  This analysis will be performed in Python, utilizing Patplotlib.pyplot, pandas, scipy.stats, and numpy.

## Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

## About
Analyzing data to determine which drugs from ten that were choosen would be the best at decreasing tumor volume (mm3) over a period of 45 days in mice that have Small Cell Carcinoma.  This analysis will be performed in Python, utilizing Patplotlib.pyplot, pandas, scipy.stats, and numpy.  My observations can be found at the top of the Jupyter notebook titled 'pymaceuticals small cell carcinoma drugs'.  The raw data that is utilized in this project can be found in the 'data' file.  

## Getting Started
Ensure that you have Python 3.0 installed, as well as Matplotlib, Pandas, Scipy, and numpy modules present in your working environment.  The code file utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for the testing environment.
