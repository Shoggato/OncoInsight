# Pymaceuticals_challenge
Analyzing data to determine which drugs from eight that were choosen would be the best at decreasing tumor volume (mm3) over a period of 45 days in mice that have Small Cell Carcinoma.  This analysis will be performed in Python, utilizing Patplotlib.pyplot, pandas, scipy.stats, and numpy.

## About
Analyzing data to determine which drugs from eight that were choosen would be the best at decreasing tumor volume (mm3) over a period of 45 days in mice that have Small Cell Carcinoma.  This analysis will be performed in Python, utilizing Patplotlib.pyplot, pandas, scipy.stats, and numpy.  My observations can be found at the top of the Jupyter notebook titled 'pymaceuticals small cell carcinoma drugs'.  The raw data that is utilized in this project can be found in the 'data' file.  

## Getting Started
Ensure that you have Python 3.0 installed, as well as Matplotlib, Pandas, Scipy, and numpy modules present in your working environment.  The code file utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for the testing environment.
